To test and run the application, you can either use a virtual machine in Android Studio or your physical device with Expo. 

### Using Android Studio Virtual Device

1. **Set Up Android Studio:**
   - If you haven't already, download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
   - Open Android Studio and go to the AVD Manager to set up a virtual device.

2. **Create a Virtual Device:**
   - In AVD Manager, click on "Create Virtual Device".
   - Choose a device definition and select a system image (like a version of Android).
   - Finish the setup and launch the virtual device.

3. **Run the App on the Virtual Device:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the app using:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

### Using Expo with Your Physical Device

1. **Install Expo:**
   - If you havenâ€™t already, install Expo CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```
   - Install the Expo app on your iOS or Android phone from the App Store or Google Play Store.

2. **Start the Expo Project:**
   - In your project directory, start the Expo project:
     ```bash
     expo start
     ```

3. **Scan the QR Code:**
   - Open the Expo app on your phone and scan the QR code provided in the terminal or command prompt.
   - Your app should now start running on your device.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, make sure that:
- Your development server is running.
- The virtual device or your physical device is properly set up and connected.
- You have the latest version of Node.js, React Native, and Expo CLI installed.
